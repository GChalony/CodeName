# CodeName repo

This repo is meant to host the code needed to create a Web App to play Code Name.

The website is currently hosted on Heroku, available at [https://guessmywords.herokuapp.com](https://guessmywords.herokuapp.com).

## Structure

Backend built with Flask, served on Gunicorn (using evenlet).

The website contains 3 main pages:
 - Home, where you can define your avatar's name and image, and create or join a room.
 - The waiting room, where you wait you team players to join and you can decide on the teams
 - The game, where you can obviously play, but also communicate via chat.
